# Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will default on a loan using machine learning classification techniques. It helps assess financial risk using customer demographic and financial data.

## 🎯 Objective
To classify customers into:
- 0 → No Loan Default
- 1 → Loan Default

## 📊 Dataset
Synthetic Loan Default Dataset with features such as:
- Age
- Annual Income
- Credit Score
- Loan Amount
- Employment Type
- Previous Default History

## 🔄 Machine Learning Pipeline
1. Data Cleaning
2. Feature Selection
3. One-Hot Encoding
4. Train-Test Split (Stratified)
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Prediction

## 🤖 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📈 Results
Random Forest performed best by capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow for financial risk prediction.
