# Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will default on a loan using machine learning classification techniques. It helps assess financial risk using customer demographic and financial data.

## 🎯 Objective
To classify customers into:
- 0 → No Loan Default
- 1 → Loan Default

## 📊 Dataset
Synthetic Loan Default Dataset with features such as:
- Age
- Annual Income
- Credit Score
- Loan Amount
- Employment Type
- Previous Default History

  ## ✅ Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Basic knowledge of Python and Machine Learning

### Required Python Libraries
Install the required libraries using:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


## 🔄 Machine Learning Pipeline
1. Data Cleaning
2. Feature Selection
3. One-Hot Encoding
4. Train-Test Split (Stratified)
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Prediction

## 🤖 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📈 Results
Random Forest performed best by capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

▶️ How to Run the Model
Option 1: Run on Google Colab (Recommended)
Open Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com
   -Click File → Upload notebook
   -Upload loan_default_prediction.ipynb
